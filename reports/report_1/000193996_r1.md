# Report 1: Machine Learning Methods That Economists Should Know About (Athey & Imbens, 2019)
What is the research question of the article?

The paper considers the relevance and progress that ML tools have within economic and econometric analysis. It explains that there are certain tools that can greatly contribute to research needs and that if the objective is to use data to solve problems, ML methods are a powerful tool that should be developed. They propose that, in the future, researchers will have to be clear about the objectives of their research and opt for one of the two methodologies in search of exploring their individual advantages and outputs.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The authors present a review of the different econometric techniques and compare their benefits with those of ML. They describe their objectives, the outputs of each method, the different interpretation perspectives they provide and their limitations. Although this is a great strength of the paper, it recognizes that with the future advancement of the literature, its review could result insufficient.

How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

The paper demonstrates that both types of tools can complement each other within the skillset of an economist. It talks about the advances that economic science could have if it rescues the most important aspects of ML methodologies and implements them to solve problems present within traditional econometric analyses. In addition, it explains the differences in the methodological approach to the data in order to complement each other (while in an econometric model the selection of variables is part of the theory in ML you let the data speak for themselves).

What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

1. Empirical applications: Encourages researchers to use these new tools and exploit their advantages to resolve past questions or generate new ones.
2. Integration of ML in academic training: Commitment to the integration of new methodologies in the training of future economists. Thus, the new generations have internalized these new methodologies and will be able to exploit them in the future.
